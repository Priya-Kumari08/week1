The Garbage Classification using Transfer Learning project progressed successfully from start to finish. Initially, we focused on understanding the problem and collecting a suitable dataset. The dataset consisted of images categorized into different classes of waste—organic, recyclable, hazardous, and others.

Using Transfer Learning, we chose a pre-trained model (MobileNetV2) to speed up development and improve accuracy with limited data. The model was fine-tuned by modifying its top layers to match our classification needs.

Key Highlights:
✅ Preprocessing: All images were resized and augmented to improve model generalization.

✅ Model Training: With the help of transfer learning, the model reached over 90% validation accuracy within a few epochs.

✅ Challenges Overcome:

We initially faced issues with class imbalance, which were resolved through data augmentation and weighted loss functions.

Hardware limitations were managed by using lighter models like MobileNet and training in Google Colab.

✅ Testing & Results: The final model was able to classify unseen garbage images with high accuracy and speed, showing strong potential for real-world deployment.

Outcome:
The project was a success—it demonstrated that transfer learning is an effective and efficient method for automating waste classification. It helped build a smart model that can contribute to better waste management, recycling processes, and environmental sustainability.
